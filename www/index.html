<p>Websites are made up of <span class="keyword">HTML</span>, <span class="keyword">CSS</span>, and <span class="keyword">JavaScript</span>code. There can be more to it than that, but for now we're going to focus on <span class="keyword">front-end code</span>. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are front-end code.

<div class="infobox">Websites can also have <span class="keyword">back-end</span> code. Back-end code can be used to generate front-end code dynamically. While front-end code is limited in its capability, the capability of back-end code is virtually limitless. Any programming language can be used to write back-end code, such as C++, Python, Ruby, C, Lisp, Fortran, and even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck">Brainfuck</a>.
